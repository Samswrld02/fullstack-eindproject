# fullstack micro-framework/backend endproject

## What did I make?
(Note: this is still a work in progress.)
I made a decoupled front end and backend based on information from a database. I made a custom rest based api, based on the mvc structure, with a custom router that takes pulls the routes from the url and uses it as data to query.

## Setup
1. install xammp and the mysql dependancy.
2. put the whole cloned repo into the htdocs section of xammp
3. setup phpmyadmin with the login credentials in the dir: api/config/config.php. (you can set up an account in phpmyadmin using those credentials or you can change the user and login in the config.php to fit your own credentials).
4. have fun testing it out!
